            November 1895. London is shrouded in fog and Sherlock Holmes and
            Watson pass time restlessly awaiting a new case. "The London
            criminal is certainly a dull fellow," Sherlock bemoans. "There have
            been numerous petty thefts," Watson offers in response. Just then a
            telegram arrives from Sherlock's brother Mycroft with a mysterious
            case.

          Arthur Cadogan West was found dead, head crushed in on train tracks at

          Arsenal on the Bruce-Partington submarine, a secret military project.
          Plans for the submarine had been stolen and seven of the ten missing
          papers were found in West's possession. Mycroft implores Sherlock to
