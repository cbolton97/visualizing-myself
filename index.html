          November 1895. London is shrouded in fog and Sherlock Holmes and
          Watson pass time restlessly awaiting a new case. "The London criminal
          is certainly a dull fellow," Sherlock bemoans. "There have been
          numerous petty thefts," Watson offers in response. Just then a
          telegram arrives from Sherlock's brother Mycroft with a mysterious
          case.
