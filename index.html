          <h1>Time Well Spent</h1>
          <p class="subtitle">
            Visualizing a month of work school, and life at UBC
          </p>

          <p>
            Since I started living, working, and going to school on the UBC
            campus over four years ago, I've always wondered how I spent my time
            here. I instinctively knew that I spent the majority of my life in
            just a handful of places, but I exactly sure why or how they
            compared against each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Armed with data from Google Calendar and my task management app
            Trello, this project aims to answer this question once and for all.
            For the purposes of visualization, I decided to focus on just one
            month during one term of my time at UBC.
            <strong>October 2019</strong> serves as a representative sample of
            where I was and what I was doing during the first term of my fifth
            year.
          </p>

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            After completing this work, I learned that the vast majority of my
            time was spent at just 18 places. I also learned that despite my
            assumption that I spend 99% of my life on school, I actually only
            spent 30% of the month on academics. Personal time made up 58% of my
            time, although sleeping took up about half of that. I also noticed
            that I didn‚Äôt workout at all for the month of October. While I know
            this isn‚Äôt representative of the entire term, it does show a lack of
            balance for the month.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of academics, the time breakdown showed that my HCI and
            Software Project courses took up the most time, which wasn‚Äôt a
            surprise (especially since HCI had lots of lab work in the fall). It
            was surprising how little work was spent on Software Engineering, as
            I was working on a class project at the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, the visualization gave me context into why I was spending
            time in the places I was during the term and how those reasons
            compared against each other.
          </p>

          <h2>Analysis and Visualization Process</h2>
          <p>
            To start my analysis, I first looked at my Calendar for October. It
            was a mess of overlapping events and assignments:
          </p>

          <img src="images/mess.png" />
          <p>
            But I was able overlay larger categories of time: personal,
            academic, work, etc:
          </p>
          <img src="images/categories.png" />

          <p>
            With this done for the entire month, I further broke down these
            categories based on real event data (cal invites, work schedule) as
            well as intuition (I spent about an hour and a half each day cooking
            and eating food). As I was drilling down, I calculated the relative
            percentages of each category.
          </p>

          <img src="images/breakdown.png" />

          <p>
            For academics, I summed up my school-related tasks for the entire
            term and broke each course into its own percentage compared to the
            entire set. I then used these percentages to allocate the total
            amount of ‚Äúacademic‚Äù time I had overlayed in my calendar.
          </p>

          <img src="images/tasks.png" />

          <p>
            Finally, I inserted this data onto a map but associated categories
            to places. This mapping isn‚Äôt perfect, but I decided to focus my
            effort on the places where the vast majority of category time was
            spent (e.g. I may have completed a few things for a course in my
            dorm but I only associate the classroom and my main study area with
            the course on the map).
          </p>

          <p>
            To create the 3D buildings and places, I used Mapbox Studio to trace
            2D building markings. I then encoded height data for both the places
            (usually rooms) and the buildings themselves:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >A collection of thoughts on the final visualization:</strong
            >
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              I chose to use hue to represent the three top-line categories
              throughout the subcategories. This ensured that even if a user was
              deep into the hierarchy, they could still associate the present
              values with an overarching theme.
            </li>

            <li>
              For representing proportions of time, I used both the length of
              the category on the time bar as well as it‚Äôs opacity. I translated
              the opacity, as well as the hue, to the underlying places on the
              map to make a strong connection between the two.
            </li>

            <li>
              Where categories had two or more associated places, but I could
              not drill further down in the data, I opted to give written
              indications of where they were on screen, using notations like
              <em>(left)</em> or <em>(right)</em>. A more perfect solution to
              this is to have labels appear on each of the places themselves,
              however this was scrapped due to the high implementation effort.
            </li>

            <li>
              When drilling down was no longer possible for a category, I opted
              to bring overall context back to the user by giving the total
              amount of hours for the month and the overall percentage compared
              to the entire month for the category.
            </li>
            <li>
              This project used
              <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a> for
              the base map and rendering engine. The rest of the project was
              developed by hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              The base map is provided by Mapbox, with slight edits made by me
              (including to remove certain labels and grey out the land)
            </li>
            <li>
              In the end, the visualization contains
              <strong>744 hours of time</strong> across
              <strong>27 categories</strong>,
              <strong>18 camera locations</strong>, <strong>18 places</strong>,
              and <strong>13 buildings</strong>,
            </li>
