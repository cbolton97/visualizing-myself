          <h1>Time Well Spent</h1>
          <p class="subtitle">Visualizing a month of work and play at UBC</p>
          <p class="subtitle">Chris Bolton | PLAN221</p>
          <p>
            Since I started living, working, and going to school on the UBC
            campus over four years ago, I've always wondered how I spent my time
            here. I instinctively knew that I spent the majority of my life in
            just a handful of places, but I exactly sure why or how they
            compared against each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Armed with data from Google Calendar and my task management app
            Trello, this project aims to answer this question once and for all.
            For the purposes of visualization, I decided to focus on just one
            month during one term of my time at UBC.
            <strong>October 2019</strong> serves as a representative sample of
            where I was and what I was doing during the first term of my fifth
            year.
          </p>

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            After completing this work, I learned that the vast majority of my
            time was spent at just 19 places. I also learned that despite my
            assumption that I spend 99% of my life on school, I actually only
            spent 30% of the month on academics. Personal time made up 58% of my
            time, although sleeping took up about half of that. I also noticed
            that I didn‚Äôt workout at all for the month of October. While I know
            this isn‚Äôt representative of the entire term, it does show a lack of
            balance for the month.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of academics, the time breakdown showed that my HCI and
            Software Project courses took up the most time, which wasn‚Äôt a
            surprise (especially since HCI had lots of lab work in the fall). It
            was surprising how little work was spent on Software Engineering, as
            I was working on a class project at the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, the visualization gave me context into why I was spending
            time in the places I was during the term and how those reasons
            compared against each other.
          </p>

          <h2>Analysis and Visualization Process</h2>

          <p>
            To start my analysis, I first looked at my Calendar for October. It
            was a mess of overlapping events and assignments. But I was able
            overlay larger categories of time: personal, academic, work, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            With this done for the entire month, I further broke down these
            categories based on real event data (cal invites, work schedule) as
            well as intuition (I spent about an hour and a half each day cooking
            and eating food). As I was drilling down, I calculated the relative
            percentages of each category.
          </p>

          <p>
            For academics, I summed up my school-related tasks for the entire
            term and broke each course into its own percentage compared to the
            entire set. I then used these percentages to allocate the total
            amount of ‚Äúacademic‚Äù time I had overlayed in my calendar.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, I inserted this data onto a map but associated categories
            to places. This mapping isn‚Äôt perfect, but I decided to focus my
            effort on the places where the vast majority of category was spent
            (e.g. I may have completed a few things for a course in my dorm but
            I only associate the classroom and my main study area with the
            course on the map).
